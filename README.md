# Responsive-Portfolio

Build a professional responsive portfolio site using HTML & CSS

## Project Files and Folders

* Create a project folder named `Responsive-Portfolio`.
* In the `Responsive-Portfolio` project folder create the following directories:
    - `assets/images`
    - `assets/css`
* In the `Responsive-Portfolio` project folder create the following files:
    - `index.html`
    - `contact.html`
    - `portfolio.html`
    - `assets/css/style.css`.

## Style Specifications

* **Responsive Breakpoints**:
    - 980px, 768px, 640px
    - Make the position of the header `static` when the screen is 640px wide.
* **Images and locations**:
    - Save all images to the `Responsive-Portfolio/assets/images/` folder.
    - For the Portfolio images, use placeholder images.
    - For the Profile image, use a picture from one of your professional online profiles.
    - For the page background pattern, consider something from [Subtle Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/ "Subtle Patterns").
* **Content Area**:
    - The width of the content area on the page is not to exceed `960px`.
    - The site header, footer backgrounds, and associated borders will use the entire width of the browser.
    - The name plate and menu in the site header are bounded by the `960px` width of the content area.
    - The site footer should stick to the bottom of the page **_[Bonus]_**.
    - The content area should float between the site header and footer, and should have a minimum distance of `32px` from the site header.
    - The content area should extend for a minimum of `32px` past the end of the content, but should not extend to the site footer, **unless** that's the amount of space used by the content.
    - Buttons use the accent color for their backgrounds.
    - Headings use the accent color as the text color.
* **Colors**:
    - Accent color: `#4aaaa5` ![#4aaaa5](https://placehold.it/15/4aaaa5/000000?text=+)
    - Base text color: `#777` ![#777](https://placehold.it/15/777/000000?text=+)
